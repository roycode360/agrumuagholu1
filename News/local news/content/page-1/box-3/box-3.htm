                        D'DISCOVERY as a programme is the brain child of a man who's earnest  desire is to see the youths of this generation take their rightful  place in the society. It is a child born out of passion to inspire and aid the 21th century youths to rise above challenges and obstacles, and to search out and fulfil their purpose or life's calling(s). Just as the convener, Mr. Promise Chinemerem Ewelike (CEO, Pee-smart clothing ) will always say, "D'DISCOVERY is a programme to help you discover the you in you". Thus the name; D'DISCOVERY. It's all about the discovery, nurture and execution of the innate abilities or talents.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-2" id="ph-2">
                        D'DISCOVERY tends to achieve this goal principally through the dissemination of quality informations, aimed at educating the youths to be proactive and to take responsibility for their own rising to greatness inspite of challenges and obstacles. The programme is meant to inspire and encourage the youths to look inside of themselves and not upon environment for the resources or fuel that will power them to fulfil destiny. It also seeks to empower the youths through it's skill aquisition programme where interested applicants are trained on a particular craft such as, tailoring, hairdressing, beading etc. The D'DISCOVERY event being a blend of education, entertainment and spirituality, features lots of  music, poetry, dancing, artistic drawings etc, with moments of powerful worship by the guest artists/ministers and also by the choir which opens up participants for divine encounters and impartation. The D'DISCOVERY programme is intentionally structured to challenge  and drive the youths to self-discovery having about 95% of it's on-scene and behind-the-scene actors as youths.<br>
                        <br>
                        The programme which holds approximately once in every four month had it's debut on Sunday, 30th september 2018, with about 500 youths In attendance. The first edition featured Dr. Kasarachi Innocent --a lecturer and an on air personality at Family love fm ph-- as the resource person. He spoke on the topic "Failed...But Not A Failure", in which he shared his inspiring personal live stories.

                        After its debut which ended as a great success, the programme has held many other times after which there were amazing harvest testimonies on each occasion.
