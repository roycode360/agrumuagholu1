                        “Welcome to 2019 harvest service,” said the harvest committee chairman, Justice Uchendu Nworgu, in his welcoming address, smiling admirably to both the camera-man and the beaming assembly, as he gave his opening remark. He was merely repeating the words of the ushers who manned the main entrance. As he spoke, thanking God for a good year and for his unmerited benevolent all through the year, the congregations were reminded of the countless privileges all enjoyed at the hands of the creator.<br>
                        <br>
                        The day was that of joy and of thanksgivings and the cheerful atmosphere in the auditorium was just terrific and absorbing. The congregation, in their best attires and ecstatic hearts, praised the name of God with maximum fascination and holy devotion. Many were in tears, thanking Him for his goodness, mercy and sustenance, and glorifying His Name for his dependable might over the devices of the enemies.<br>
                        The King James Bible dictionary defines harvest as “the season of reaping and gathering corn and other crops”. This meaning was on the mind of the reverend and members of the Assembly of God, Rumuagholu 1, when they fixed the first Sunday of December 2019 to celebrate as harvest day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-2" id="ph-2">
                        Three weeks before, the presiding reverend, Rev. Anthony Asuquo, had set up a harvest committee, with the mandate to capitalize on the short time at their disposal and map out the kernel of the occasion in a manner to make it worthwhile. The team didn’t disappoint as they swing into action immediately. It took them a week to come out with a befitting theme for the event and in the next few days, all that had to do with the harvest celebration were conceived and birthed.<br>
                        <br>
                        They brought the banner, floated a magazine and gone ahead to open niches for business’s owners to advertise their trades. The speed and expertise with which these men and women did their work said a lot about their calibre of persons, strength in agreement, desires to serve God and the foresight of the man who nominated them.<br>
                        <br>
                        As one entered the vestibule on the d-day, a confused fellow might have mistaken it for a minimarket except for the fact that the house of God is a house of God even at its great or less appearance. The mighty pillars and embellished stands were decorated with various harvest produces, ranging from giant bunches of plantains, yams, banana, to many tropical and non-tropical fruits. These were subsequently retailed to members of the congregations who desired to buy them and the proceeds went to the work of God.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-3" id="ph-3">
                        Meanwhile the exhilarating service began after the Sunday school session with a spellbinding praise and worship. Offerings and tithe payment followed and then the youths’ choir, who captivated the minds of the worshippers with their sizzling rendition. As though competing with the youth, the main choice, singing the classic notation, thrilled the gathering to a beautiful hymn and rendered all standing upon their feet in rapturous ovation. The preacher of the day, Rev. Sunny Secondus, was brief and to the point in his sermon, urging everyone to be thankful to God for what He has done to him and her, he said one’s gifts ought to be commensurate with the blessings of God upon one’s life.<br>
                        <br>
                        As you might have expected, God’s children are acquainted with how to appreciate their God and days as these merely afforded them chances show it to others as they filed out along the isles. Many donated full-size goats, gigantic chickens, bishop-size tubers of yams, varied bags of rice, Telly and other electronic appliances. But an item stood higher than the rest, it was a big cow in black and white fur and protracted hoofs, clamouring at the obverse of the church-yard. A common denominator among the presenters was their cheerfulness of hearts as they danced in His presence to present their items. Here were brethren happy, grateful and humbled by the almighty benevolence over their lives.<br>
                        <br>
                        At the end, the servant of God commanded God’s blessing and continued protection on the lives of his people and dispersed them after sharing the grace in fellowship. However, no one left the auditorium without first partaking in the abundance fruits drinks and assorted foods making the round. This was indeed a harvest service to remember for a while to come.
