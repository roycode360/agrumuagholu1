                    <h3 class="t"><b>History On Assemblies Of God Nigeria.</b></h3>

                    <p>The Assemblies of God (AG), officially the World Assemblies of God Fellowship, is a group of over 144 autonomous self-governing associated national groupings of churches which together form the world's largest Pentecostal denomination. It is the fourth largest international Christian group of denominations. As an international fellowship, the member denominations are entirely independent and autonomous; however, they are united by shared beliefs and history.<br>
                    <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>Between the years 1931 and 1935 a group of young men and women soundly converted and living at Old Umuahia, Abia State, Nigeria, were reading various religious periodicals that told of many people in many lands who were receiving the Baptism in the Holy Spirit with speaking in tongues, according to Acts 2:4. They became convinced that the Pentecostal experience was for them, too. Within a short while, many of them were blessed with the Baptism in the Holy in 1934. They established a number of churches.<br>
                    <br>
                    At that time they were not affiliated with any overseas Mission. After much prayer, they requested the American Assemblies of God to send them a resident missionary. In June 1939, Rev. & Mrs. Williams Lloyd Shirer, a Missionary in what was then called Gold Coast (Ghana) was sent to meet the few Pastors and young men of “The Church of Jesus Christ.” They worked out an agreement of affiliation with the Assemblies of God in Springfield, Missouri, U.S.A. and the “Church of Jesus Christ” was officially renamed “Assemblies of God”. Early in July 1939, the Shirers returned to Tamele, Gold Coast (Ghana).<br>
                    <br> 
                    Late in August 1939, the affiliation agreement was officially sanctioned. Rev. Shirer’s recommendation to the American Assemblies of God resulted in Rev. and Mrs. Everrest L. Philips coming to Nigeria in February 1940. Other Missionaries soon followed. From that beginning, both the Nigerian Pastors and the overseas Missionaries found a great response to their preaching of the Gospel and church planting efforts.<br>
                    <br> 
                    One of the first projects they embarked on was to establish a Bible School at Old Umuahia, Abia State, where the young pastors could receive training for the Ministry. Later, a Printing Press was established at Aba, Abia State, to provide printed materials for the young, growing and multiplying churches.<br>
                    <br>
                    That Printing Press is still operating and is producing huge amounts of literature not only for the Nigerian Assemblies of God but for other churches, too. And that one Bible School has grown to ten schools strategically located in the country.</p>
